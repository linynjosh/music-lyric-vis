Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in thirty years
And wonder who you're married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I'll blame it all on being young
Got no regrets 'cause it got me here
But I don't wanna waste another one
I've been thinking about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose
There'd only be one thing
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
I don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
I wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
I don't wanna live without you (I don't wanna live)
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me (next to me)
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (I don't wanna love nobody)
Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
I don't wanna love nobody (you)
I don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
